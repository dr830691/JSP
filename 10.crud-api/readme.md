**CRUD App README**  
This README provides an overview and setup instructions for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)   application built with TypeScript, Express.js, and MongoDB.  
**Prerequisites**  
Make sure you have the following installed:  
Node.js and npm  
MongoDB  
**Installation**  
**Clone the repository:**  
*git clone <repository_url>*  
**Navigate into the project directory:**  
*cd <project_directory>*  
**Initialize npm:**  
*npm init -y*  
**Install dependencies:**  
*npm install typescript nodemon ts-node mongodb mongoose router routes*  
**Configuration**  
Ensure MongoDB is running locally or update the MONGO_URL in index.ts with your MongoDB connection string.  
If needed, modify the SECRET variable in helpers.ts for JWT token generation.  
**Running the Application**  
To start the server, run:  
*npm start*  
The server will start on http://localhost:8080/.  
**API Endpoints**  
**Authentication**  
POST /auth/register: Register a new user.  
POST /auth/login: Login with existing credentials.  
**Users**  
GET /users: Retrieve all users (requires authentication).  
DELETE /user/:id: Delete a user by ID (requires authentication).  
**Middlewares**  
isAuthenticated: Middleware to check if a user is authenticated. It verifies JWT token in cookies.  
**Project Structure**  
controllers/: Contains controller functions for handling various endpoints.  
db/: Includes MongoDB models and database functions.  
middlewares/: Contains custom middleware functions like authentication.  
routers/: Defines route handlers for different endpoints.  
helpers/: Contains utility functions like password hashing and token generation.  
index.ts: Entry point of the application.  
**Dependencies**  
express: Web framework for Node.js.  
mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool.  
jsonwebtoken: JSON Web Token implementation.  
body-parser: Parses incoming request bodies.  
cookie-parser: Parses cookies attached to the client request.  
cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.  
compression: Middleware for compressing HTTP responses.  
lodash: Utility library for JavaScript.  
nodemon: Utility for auto-restarting the server during development.  
typescript: Programming language for large-scale JavaScript application development.  
**Development**  
During development, you can run the application in watch mode to automatically restart on file changes:  
*npm run start*  
**Production**  
For production deployment, consider building the TypeScript files into JavaScript and running the server   using a process manager like PM2 or deploying on platforms like Heroku or AWS.
**Conclusion**  
This README provides a basic setup and usage guide for the CRUD application. Customize and extend it as   needed for your specific requirements.
